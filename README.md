This repository contains a set of performance evaluations and their results as well as related case studies for the [TraDE middleware](https://github.com/traDE4chor/trade-core).

## initial-evaluation
An initial collection of performance evaluation scenarios comparing TraDE-based cross-partner data objects and data flow with the classical exchange of data through messages within service choreographies. Further information about the evaluation scenarios and their results are provided [here](initial-evaluation/README.md).

## opal-case-study
A case study from the eScience domain as an example for using TraDE-based cross-partner data objects, data flow and data transformations within service choreographies. Further information about the case study as well as its related models and resources are provided [here](opal-case-study/README.md).
